electron todo:
 - make icons for mac and windows
 - verify mac works
 - verify downloading from IE works. maybe sign it?
 - Make an install script that deletes stuff from the repo and moves the media around.
 - Make a loading prompt when wilddog is slow.
 - consider "value" instead of "child_added" for classes. This should not be dynamic. maybe it will be faster.
 - Fix the window size.
 - Auto-updater (where to host stuff, etc)
